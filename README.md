# Secret Keeper
Secret Keeper or sharedprefs is an android application which stores a line of user input untill some new input is given. I made this application using android studio in Java language.

## Working
1. First, the user gives an input line.
2. When the user clicks on the button the application stores that input.
3. when the user inputs a new line, the previous line deletes itself.

## Apk
The apk of this application can be found in the apk folder.
